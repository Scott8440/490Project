The first challenge that will need to be faced is the task of converting source code which begins as simple text files into manipulable and useful internal representations. To do this I will make use of available lexical parsers for certain programming languages. These lexical elements will then need to be parsed into the main structures that will be analyzed. I will need to first create representations for the smallest elements, variables. Then functions, and finally "ClasseFor example I will need to create a representation for a "Class" or "Object." This will need to include both
